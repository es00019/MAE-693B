# MAE-693B
Space for my MAE 693B projects/homeworks.

For homework 1, I made a mistake because my code always returns the value function of 0. I am unsure of what my mistake is, but I know that this result is wrong. 

For homework 2, I started my final run at 9pm and it took longer than expected to complete. I apologize for the late submission. 

On the final, I could not get a mathematical model of the system working with the Q-learning. I went into more detail in my paper. This code is just the Q-learning of the simulator.
